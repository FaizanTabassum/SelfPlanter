# selfplanter-
this is the first stable version of the self planter all functions working rtc module not yet added and light time not configurable, we need to add the serial communications for the arduino and the pi,
sometimes arduino keeps resetting but mostly this version is stable.
to fix most of the issues currently we need to add an rtc module and use the time from it to calculate light on and off time
right nowe in this current code the light works of off the millis() function to calculate the on and off for every 12 hours
